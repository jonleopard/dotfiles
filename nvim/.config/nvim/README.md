# init.vim

Since I am using neovim rather than Vim, I place all of my configuration inside init.vim instead of a .vimrc file. Vim plugin management is done with vim-plug.

TODO: Add nvim lsp, lua documentation. I'll be slowly migrating more of this over to lua.

I manage installation of LSP servers rather than using an installer such as [lsp-install](https://github.com/kabouzeid/nvim-lspinstall)
