## Introduction

This is my development environment that I use everyday. Dotfiles allow you to backup, restore, and sync your dev environment. This is great, especially if you have more than one workstation or are migrating to a new machine. After much research and observation of how other people manage their dotfiles, what you see in this repo is a reflection of their efforts as well as my own.

I initially started this repo to help myself learn more about the tools available out there for customizing my dev environment. I also wanted to make sure that all my customizations were backed up and could be installed on any machine. As I continued learning, adding, and breaking things, I thought it would be a good idea to document as much as I could to not only learn, but help others in setting up their dotfiles as well. I hope this repo can help newcomers understand their own environment and aid them in their own creation of a dotfile repo. Be aware that I am still learning, so proceed with caution. If you are uncertain about anything, I highly advise you read the source before executing any of these scripts.

If you have any improvements or suggestions, please feel free to submit it [here](https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfiles/issues) or [contact me](https://twitter.com/jonlprd)

Lastly, I have created a minimal dotfile repo for to help new users get started on their own dotfile journey. You can check out the project here: https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfile-starter.





#### Todo

[View the todo board here](https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfiles/projects/1)


## Installation

At the moment, this will only work in macOS. I'd love for this to work on linux distros too, feel free to submit a PR!

**Disclaimer:** If you decide to use these dotfiles, please fork this repo and review the source code before executing! Proceed at your own risk!

1.  Download repo

* via git
* via cURL

2.  Run scripts <--Currently working on these!

* Automatic: ./install.sh
* Manually: stow [folder]

3.  Done!

### Download and Stage Files

If you are just setting up a new machine, you might not already have git installed. If this is the case, then run the cURL command in your home `$HOME` directory. If you already have git, then use git clone. It's imperative you place the dotfiles folder into your home directory. Not sure where that is? Run `echo $HOME`. Read [Dotfile Management](https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfiles#dotfile-management) for more details.

### git

```bash
cd git clone https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && chmod +x install.sh
```

### curl

```bash
cd curl -#L https://github.com/jonleopard/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv
```

If you prefer, you can skip the install.sh script and run stow manually. Just tell stow which dotfiles you want to symlink:

```
stow example_folder
```



## Mangement Tools


### dotfiles - gnu stow

There are [so many flavors](https://www.reddit.com/r/fossworldproblems/comments/2jk4gi/there_are_too_many_solutions_for_managing_dotfiles/) when it comes to dotfile management. I wanted something lightweight and that could run in any \*nix environment with little to no dependencies.

All my dotfiles are managed with the extremely light weight [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Basically, stow creates & manages symlinks to files that are located in the home directory. This allows me to keep everything in an organized folder called 'dotfiles'. If you are interested in learning more about stow, I wrote a brief post about it [here](https://jonleopard.com/blog/dotfile-management-with-gnu-stow/)

### macOS - Homebrew

Homebrew and Macports are pretty much the only mainstream options here. I went with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). My Brewfile with generated with [Homebrew-Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle). I'm using [Homebrew-Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) which will go out and install all of the applications that I tell it to. [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) will install all of your Mac App Store apps. All of this is bundled in a list called Brewfile.

**node - n**

[n](https://github.com/tj/n) allows me to switch between different node versions on the fly. I've installed `n` via [n-install](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install). Also, on the topic of node, I've installed `yarn` globally via `brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies` (allows for yarn to plug into your node binary that `n` installed). 

**zsh - antibody**

[antibody](http://getantibody.github.io/) has been my favorite zsh plugin mananger for a couple years now. The author has a great post on shell performance which I highly recommend if you are interested in speeding up your shell spawn times. It's written in go, so make sure you have go installed on your system.

**tmux - tpm**

[tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (which stands for tmux plugin manager) is a great little that has zero dependencies. Be sure to check out the [plugin](https://github.com/tmux-plugins) directory. 

**neovim - vim plug**

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) manages all of my vim plugins. It pairs nicely with [Neovim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#neovim).

## The Terminal


**alacritty + zsh**
As you could have guessed by now, I am using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) instead of bash as my unix shell. [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) is my terminal emulator and [Pure Prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) is the shell prompt.


**Dev Fonts**

Below is a list of some of my favourite dev fonts that go great in your terminal, IDE, Text Editor, etc...
* [Hack Font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
* [mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/)
* [Tamsyn Font](http://www.fial.com/~scott/tamsyn-font/)
* [Consolas](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/consolas)
* [Adobe Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
* [Pragmata Pro](http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)

If you need a [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) font, a list of those can be found here: [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). You could also check out the [Nerd Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com/) repo for a list of patched fonts and install them via homebrew.


## Wallpapers
I've been working a collection of my favorite wallpapers over the years. If you are interested, you can grab the bundle [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/phhmo009i52wp0r/AAAOhBkQrMM3a3Iy9e3n_aKAa?dl=0).
